Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## 📂 Dataset
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **```sales```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The sales table captures all ```customer_id``` level purchases with an corresponding ```order_date``` and ```product_id``` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

|customer_id|order_date|product_id|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|A          |2021-01-01|1         |
|A          |2021-01-01|2         |
|A          |2021-01-07|2         |
|A          |2021-01-10|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |

|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |

The menu table maps the ```product_id``` to the actual ```product_name``` and price of each menu item.

|1          |sushi       |10        |
|2          |curry       |15        |
|3          |ramen       |12        |

</details>

### **```members```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The final members table captures the ```join_date``` when a ```customer_id``` joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.

|customer_id|join_date |
|-----------|----------|
|A          |1/7/2021  |
|B          |1/9/2021  |

 </details>
